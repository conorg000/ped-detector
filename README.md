# Pedestrian detector
This project looks as fine-tuning a pre-trained object detection model so that it performs better at the task of pedestrian detection.

This repo makes heavy use of Tensorflow's [Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). Set-up instructions are included in the quick start guide, but feel free to refer to the official API documentation if things don't make sense.

Provided below is a quick start guide on how to set things up and start inference asap.

There is also an extended guide discussing the fine-tuning pipeline, in the hope that results can be reproduced.
